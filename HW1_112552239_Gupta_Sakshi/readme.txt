CSE 532- Homework 1

In createdeatable.sql and createzip.sql, I used COMPRESS YES ADAPTIVE as I wanted less storage consumption.
In createdeaindexes.sql, I made two indexes ix_date and ix_zip on the TRANSACTION_DATE and ZIP columns and it reduced the time and resource consumption a little bit.


I used Docker for my implementation and all my files were kept in the Desktop Directory.

I have also included q3a.png which has the chart, q3a_result.csv with the 108 rows in the result set and q3b.png has the screenshot of the output of query 3b.
